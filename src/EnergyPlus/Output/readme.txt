This file will contain the output of EnergyPlus runs.

It also contains the original copies of the Scenario.rvi used to generate hourly data during a scenario simulation, as well as a cwf.rvi used to generate weather-only hourly data when importing a location and creating a ComfenWeatherFile (cwf).

Please don't delete or move either .rvi file.
