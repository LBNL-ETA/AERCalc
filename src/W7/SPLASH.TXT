Berkeley Lab WINDOW 7 has the ability to model windows with shading layers, dynamic glazing, vacuum glazing and glazing deflection.  The selection of shading systems has been expanded and besides venetian blinds and woven shades, which were included in WINDOW 6.3, it now also includes cellular shades, vertical louvered blinds, perforated screens and shades with measured BSDF.
